As we stand on the precipice of an exciting new chapter, we at Tiny Forge Studios can't help but reflect on the incredible journey we've had thus far. We are truly humbled by the success of our first game, Tiny Tactics, and the passionate community that has rallied around it. Our team has poured its heart and soul into creating an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience, and we couldn't be more thrilled with the response we've received from players worldwide.

Tiny Tactics has exceeded our wildest expectations, and its success has only fueled our ambition to continue pushing the boundaries of what indie games can achieve. With that said, we're excited to share some insights into what the future holds for Tiny Forge Studios.

Our primary goal moving forward is to develop games that further promote healthy monetization practices in the gaming industry. We believe that ethical and transparent monetization models are crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability of our industry, and we're committed to being a part of the solution. We're currently hard at work on a new project that embodies these values and can't wait to share more details with you soon!

We also believe that the era of indie gaming is just around the corner. As the barriers to entry for game development continue to lower, we expect to see an explosion of creativity and innovation from independent developers worldwide. To support this movement, we're dedicated to providing tutorials, guides, and other resources to help aspiring game creators break into the industry and bring their unique visions to life. By empowering the indie dev scene, we hope to contribute to a more diverse and vibrant gaming landscape that benefits everyone.

Lastly, we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you who has played, supported, and provided feedback on Tiny Tactics. Your enthusiasm and constructive criticism have been invaluable in shaping the game into what it is today, and we're committed to taking your feedback to heart as we continue developing new and exciting experiences.

In conclusion, the future of Tiny Forge Studios is bright and full of promise.
