# Tiny Tactics

{% include embed/youtube.html id='OEnXZ76HoTc' %}
  

Tiny Tactics is a Tower Defense game with a heavy focus on mazing, with mechanics inspired by the Auto Chess genre.

Tiny Tactics is a love letter to those of us who enjoy focusing on mazing in a Tower Defense. You will be considering your enemy’s path at all times while you try to upgrade your units by combining duplicates, getting the perfect class combinations, and placing the right units with abilities in the right spot to maximise their impact. After mastering the mechanics of the game, players can push themselves with challenge modes that unlock when they’ve reached the end of the campaign map.
